    <h1 class="title">Our Instructors</h1>
    <p class="body text-align-left font-size-150 line-height-150">We are a small team of 15 young, university-graduate professionals operating an educational start-up in South Korea. In 2015, fellow UC Berkeley alumni established an intensive conversational English program working with international graduate students in Berkeley, California. This lead us to adopt and implement a similar model abroad. We chose Seoul as the launching point to expand our efforts internationally, as we believe it is the perfect cultural climate to exchange our heritages and languages as well as our educational and professional experiences.</p>
